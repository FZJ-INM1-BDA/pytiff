# pytiff

pytiff is a lightweight library for reading chunks from a tiff file. While it supports other formats to some extend, it is focused on reading tiled greyscale/rgb images, that can also be bigtiffs. Writing tiff files is now partly supported. It is able to save uncompressed greyscale images in tiled or scanline format. More information can be found in the documentation. Pytiff supports numpy like slicing and uses numpy arrays to handle image data.

The libtiff library is wrapped using the Cython package.

## Dependencies

- libtiff C library (>= 4.0 for bigtiff access)
- Cython >= 0.23
- numpy

## Installation

### Installation on Linux / Mac

Just use pip

```bash
pip install pytiff
```

or from sources: clone the repo and call setup.py.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FZJ-INM1-BDA/pytiff.git
cd pytiff
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install . # or python setup.py install
```

### Installation on Windows

**Recommended**: Use Anaconda

    * Install Anaconda or Miniconda
    * Install [Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools)
    * Install Visual C++ using Visual Studio (development headers..)
    * Set your INCLUDE environment variable to "path\to\anaconda\Library\include"
    * Set LIB environment variable to point to "tiff.lib" or Copy tiff.lib from "Anaconda\Library\lib\" into the installation directory
    * Start Visual Studio Development CMD
    * `python setup.py install`

## Development

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FZJ-INM1-BDA/pytiff.git
cd pytiff
# git checkout develop
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e . # or python setup.py develop
```

can be used, so that no reinstallation is needed for every update.
If new updates are pulled the cython part has to be recompiled.

```bash
#compile cython part
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

## Usage

A small example how pytiff can be used:

Reading:

```python
import pytiff

with pytiff.Tiff("test_data/small_example_tiled.tif") as handle:
  part = handle[100:200, :]
```

Writing data from `pages` into a multipage tiff:

```python
import pytiff
with pytiff.Tiff("test_data/tmp.tif", "w") as handle:
  for p in pages:
    handle.write(p, method="scanline")
```
